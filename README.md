# Benji Badger Bot

## Motivation

This project came about after my brother's dog, Benji, went missing. After nearly 4 long days and nights searching for him (and increasingly coming to terms with the worst case scenario), he was retreived safe and sound from an inactive badger sett. The search was coordinated by a group of volunteers, known as K9 SARs. They've been wanting to invest in equipment to help them investigate burrows and setts that are known to be inactive.

## Goal

To create a simple robot capable of remote control under dense ground.

* Small enough to explore inactive badger setts
* Front facing camera & lights
* Mobile phone control - should feel natural to drive
* Remote control, but tethered for retreival

## Design

We are exploring a tracked vehicle which will have onboard power. However, rather than a wireless signal which may be prone to dropping, it will use fiber optics.
